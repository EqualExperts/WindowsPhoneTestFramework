#WindowsPhoneTestFramework

There is an introduction video on 

             http://bit.ly/wp7-test

There are some Wiki Pages now on

##General setup

For adding BDD to a class library project, see:

			https://github.com/Expensify/WindowsPhoneTestFramework/wiki/Writing-a-new-SpecFlow-test-project-for-WindowsPhoneTestFramework
			
For adding the test client to a WP7 project, see:

##NuGet setup - wp7 app

If you have installed from NuGet into your WP7 App, then:

1. in the App.xaml.cs constructor, add

	```
            #if DEBUG
            WindowsPhoneTestFramework.AutomationClient.Automation.Instance.Initialise();
            #endif // DEBUG
	```

If you have installed from NuGet into your test class library, then:

1. Change the project Build from "Any CPU" to "x86" only

2. Edit app.config to provide the necessary configuration values for your app

    Be especially careful about the paths
	
	For finding the ProductId, see the WMAppManifest.xml file.
	
3. Add a new feature:

	```
	Feature: App Test
		In order to test my app
		As a WP7 Developer
		I want to see it start and take a picture of it

	Scenario: Start the app
		Given my app is uninstalled
		And my app is installed
		And my app is running
		Then I wait 5 seconds
		Then take a picture
	```
	
4. Run the tests


#Prerequisites

To get this to work, you need to install:

- wp7 7.1 mango dev tools - so far not tested on the free Express versions

- nunit

- specflow


#Some possible problems:

- For non-English setups (outside of US, UK, AU, etc) you may find you are not able to create the emulator - this is due to internationalised emulator device names (currently I'm looking for a list).

	There is now some code to help work around this - but if the emulator does not start in your SDK, then please get in touch.
	If you want to try fixing this yourselves, take a look at the device name in DriverBase.cs and EmulatorDriver.cs

- For some script runners, then you may need to change script runner to have the 32-big flag set - try to find a 32-bit alternative (e.g. nunit-console-x86.exe) - or (at worst) use CorFlags.exe to change your test-runner.

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin\CorFlags.exe" "your target.exe" /32BIT+

- The server part of the code opens a WCF service on http://localhost:8085 - it needs permission to do this - use:

     netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8085/ user=<domain>\<user>

	 
#Source code build

To start:

1. Open and build the whole solution - Debug configuration

2. Open a command prompt and run "cscript runspec.js" inside the Example directory - this will run all the specflow features

3. Try running the emuHost command line tool, then try commands like:

    help
    install
    launch
    click Go!
	setText TextBoxInput=hello world
	getText TextBoxOutput
	doSwipe LeftToRight

	
#Source code - using the test platform

To work out how to use the test platform in your own apps:

1. Try looking at the code for ExampleApp - there's only one line that's added to enable testing - `Automation.Instance.Initialise();` in App.xaml.cs

2. Try looking at the gherkin code in the ExampleApp.Spec features
