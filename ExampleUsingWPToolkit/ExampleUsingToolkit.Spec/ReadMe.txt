This project was initially created as a way to test the automatability for various controls in the Windows Phone toolkit.

It still has that intention, but at the moment that hasn't been done.

It remains, because it is an example of a WP8 application using the test framework.

It also is intended to test the multiple-emulator support for the framework. But the ability to run multiple tests concurrently
has been stripped out for now. (Although the support remains in the framework.)
